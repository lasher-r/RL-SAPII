# RL-SAPII

This is a version of the sapII from _book_

I was inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit computer and found _book_ while doing research. I like the idea of a more powerful ALU so I went with a mix between Ben Eater's breadboard computer and the SAPII.

I designed this during the COVID-19 pandemic in logism because I can't get to my makerspace. I designed it with the intention of building it with the 74ls chip series.

I add ROM because the idea of the program being loaded into RAM manually seems exhausting and I like the idea of swappable programs.

I Also omit most IO. Mostly as a result of lack of interest and self assigned scope.
